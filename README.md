# ENGG-200-Project-3-CATCHERS-
Original name: Intercosmic Invaders!
Changed to CATCHERS!


This was an Arduino project where we designed a handheld console to run a game for a school assignment. The game was designed to catch balls, slowly upping the difficulty by making the balls fall faster. Many features such as a score tracker, joystick sensor system, power system, and battery level tracking system were included in the design.
